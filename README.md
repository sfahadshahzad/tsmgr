**tsmgr** is a tool for creating custom [MPEG-TS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_transport_stream) multiplexes in real-time as part of an IP-based broadcast monitoring system.

It relies heavily on [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) for stream encoding, and [TSDuck](https://tsduck.io/) for stream routing.
